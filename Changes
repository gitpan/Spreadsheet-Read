    - -? and --help in utils moved to Getopt::Long
    - Adjusted copyright notice in utils
    - removed prototypes in utils
    - next is illegal in do {} while (); (Johan Vromans)
      only happens with old Text::CSV_XS

      Thanks to David Cantrell for making a OpenBSD test box available!

    - Also use 3-arg open in test files
    - die if test files cannot be opene'ed

0.22	Mon 18 Jun 2007

    - 0.21 should already support Text::CSV_PP 1.05
      Tested Text::CSV_PP 1.05 on bleadperl.
    - Better detection of (not) installed modules

      parsing CSV with embedded eol sequences is now safe.
    - As I now also maintain Text::CSV_XS, I changed the references
    - Changed TODO's from Text::CSV to Text::CSV_PP (::CSV is dated 1997)

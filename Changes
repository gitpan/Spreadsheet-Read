Revision history for Spreadsheet::Read

0.24	Thu 05 Oct 2007

    - -? and --help in utils moved to Getopt::Long
    - Adjusted copyright notice in utils
    - removed prototypes in utils
    - next is illegal in do {} while (); (Johan Vromans)
      only happens with old Text::CSV_XS

0.23	Thu 21 Jun 2007

    - Use IO::Scalar instead of File::Temp when installed
      Thanks to David Cantrell for making a OpenBSD test box available!
    - use binmode () when opening files
    - Also use 3-arg open in test files
    - die if test files cannot be opene'ed

0.22	Mon 18 Jun 2007

    - 0.21 should already support Text::CSV_PP 1.05
      Tested Text::CSV_PP 1.05 on bleadperl.
    - Better detection of (not) installed modules
    - Module requires perl 5.6.x

0.21	Mon 18 Jun 2007

    - Text::CSV_XS uses keep_meta_info instead of get_flags
    - Removed always_quote from xlscat's CSV output

0.20	Thu 31 May 2007

    - perlcritic OK
    - CSV parsing now uses getline (), and auto-detects eol
      Assumes first line does not contain embedded eol. This implies that
      parsing CSV with embedded eol sequences is now safe.
    - As I now also maintain Text::CSV_XS, I changed the references
    - Changed TODO's from Text::CSV to Text::CSV_PP (::CSV is dated 1997)

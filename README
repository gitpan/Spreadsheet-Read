various types of spreadsheets and deal with these in a transparent way.

  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make install

If the C<make test> warns you in the xls tests, read the message and
apply the generated patch. Spreadsheet::ParseExcel has a small bug in
the parsing of the default format regarding UTF-8.

  * Make tests for examples/xlscat
  * Field attributes (See Read.pm - TODO)
  * Support Parsers native module options
  * PreReq modules should be optional
